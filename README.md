Java code for Dimensional Deduction Using SVD

Dimensional Deduction Using SVD:

Please implement a program to do dimensional deduction using Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD) with best rank k (k < rank(A)) with minimum Frobenius norm. You can either 1) implement in C/C++/Java with either both number of rows and columns less than 4 or with integer roots in solving the equation for eigen values, or 2) implement in Python without any restriction.
